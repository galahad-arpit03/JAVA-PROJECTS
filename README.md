# Java String Manipulation Programs

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate various string manipulation techniques. Each program addresses a specific problem statement involving strings, showcasing fundamental concepts in Java programming.

## Programs

### 1. Check for Palindrome
**Question:** Write a Program to check whether a given String is Palindrome or not.

**Input:** "madam"  
**Output:** "The string is a palindrome."

### 2. Concatenate Strings
**Question:** Write a Java program that will concatenate 7 strings and return the result. The result should be in lowercase. Note: If the concatenation creates a double character, then one of the characters needs to be omitted.

**Input:** "Sachin", "Tendulkar"  
**Output:** "sachintendulkar"

**Input:** "Mark", "Kate"  
**Output:** "markate"

### 3. Repeat First Two Characters
**Question:** Given a string, return a new string made of 'n' copies of the first 2 chars of the original string where 'n' is the length of the string.

**Input:** "Wipro"  
**Output:** "wiwiwiwiwi"

### 4. Return First Half of the String
**Question:** Write a Java program that will return the first half of the string if the length of the string is even. It should return null for odd length strings.

**Input:** "TomCat"  
**Output:** "Tom"

**Input:** "Apron"  
**Output:** null

### 5. Remove First and Last Character
**Question:** Write a Java program that accepts a string and returns a new string without the first and last character of the input string.

**Input:** "Suman"  
**Output:** "uma"

### 6. Short-Long-Short Combination
**Question:** Given two strings, a and b, return a new string of the form short + long + short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside.

**Input:** "hi", "hello"  
**Output:** "hihellohi"

### 7. Remove Specific Characters
**Question:** Given a string, if the first or last chars are 'x', return the string without those "x" chars; otherwise, return the string unchanged.

**Input:** "xAmerica"  
**Output:** "America"

**Input:** "xHis"  
**Output:** ""

### 8. Remove Surrounding Characters
**Question:** Write a Java program that accepts a string and returns a new string in which the characters that are to the left and right of a specified character are removed.

**Input:** "abcd"  
**Output:** "ad"

### 9. Combine Characters from Two Strings
**Question:** Given two strings, a and b, print a new string which is made of the following combination: first character of a, the first character of b, second character of a, second character of b, and so on. Any characters left will go to the end of the result.

**Input:** "Hello", "World"  
**Output:** "HWoe ll"

### 10. Repeat Last N Characters
**Question:** Given a string and an integer n, print a new string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive.

**Input:** "Wipro", 3  
**Output:** "propropro"
