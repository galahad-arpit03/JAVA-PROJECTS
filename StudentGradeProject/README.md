Student Grade Validation & Reporting System
Project Overview
This project is a Java-based console application designed to manage and validate student data, calculate grades based on student marks, and handle errors gracefully through exception handling. The program demonstrates the use of custom exceptions, data validation, and grade calculation using an array of Student objects. It provides detailed feedback for invalid student entries and generates a summary of the results.

Features
Student Data Validation:

Ensures that each student object has valid data, including non-null names and marks.
Verifies that the Student object itself is not null.
Custom Exception Handling:

Handles specific exceptions for null marks arrays, null student names, and null student objects.
Provides meaningful feedback when invalid data is encountered.
Grade Calculation:

Computes grades for students based on the average of their marks.
Provides a range of grades from A+ to F based on the student's performance.
Summary Report:

Provides a count of null marks arrays, null student names, and null student objects.
Modular Code Design:

Contains separate classes for validation (StudentService), grade calculation (StudentReport), and custom exception handling.
Questions and Explanations
1. What is the purpose of this project?
The purpose of this project is to validate student information, calculate their grades based on marks, and report any invalid or incomplete student data. It simulates a scenario where student records are processed, with some entries being incomplete or erroneous, and handles these cases using custom exceptions.

2. How does the validation process work?
The validation process is handled by the StudentService class, which includes methods that check for:

Null student objects.
Null student names.
Null marks arrays.
The validation is done using the validate() method, which throws custom exceptions when an invalid case is detected:

NullStudentObjectException: Thrown when the student object is null.
NullNameException: Thrown when the student name is null.
NullMarksArrayException: Thrown when the marks array is null.
3. How are the grades calculated for students?
Grades are computed by the findGrades() method in the StudentReport class. This method calculates the average of the marks and assigns a grade based on predefined ranges:

A+ : Marks ≥ 90
A : 80 ≤ Marks < 90
B : 70 ≤ Marks < 80
C : 60 ≤ Marks < 70
F : Marks < 60
If a student's marks are valid, their grade is printed. Otherwise, the program skips the calculation for that student.

4. What are the custom exceptions and how are they used?
The project defines three custom exceptions to handle invalid data:

NullStudentObjectException: Thrown when the student object itself is null.
NullNameException: Thrown when the student's name is null.
NullMarksArrayException: Thrown when the student's marks array is null.
These exceptions ensure that invalid student records are caught and handled gracefully, allowing the program to continue processing valid entries.

5. How is invalid data handled in the project?
When invalid data is encountered during validation, a custom exception is thrown. The exception is caught in the main() method, and an error message is printed to the console, such as:

"Student object is null."
"Student name is missing."
"Marks array is null."
In addition to printing the error, the program also maintains a count of how many invalid student objects, null names, or null marks arrays were found, and reports these counts at the end of execution.

6. How are the students initialized?
The Student objects are initialized in an array within the StudentMain class. Some student objects are complete with valid names and marks, while others are missing data (e.g., null marks, null names). This is done deliberately to test the validation and exception handling features.

Example of student initialization:

java
Copy code
data[0] = new Student("Sekar", new int[]{85, 75, 95});
data[1] = new Student(null, new int[]{11, 22, 33});
data[2] = null;
data[3] = new Student("Manoj", null);
Here:

data[0] is valid.
data[1] has a null name.
data[2] is a null student object.
data[3] has a null marks array.
7. What is the purpose of the summary report?
The summary report at the end of the program counts and prints how many students had invalid data, such as:

The number of students with null names.
The number of students with null marks arrays.
The number of completely null student objects.
This provides a clear overview of the invalid data and demonstrates the robustness of the validation process.

8. How do I run this project in Eclipse?
To run this project in Eclipse, follow these steps:

Create a new Java project in Eclipse.
Create the following classes in the project:
StudentMain: Contains the main method and student initialization.
StudentService: Handles validation methods.
StudentReport: Contains the grade calculation logic.
Custom exceptions: NullMarksArrayException, NullNameException, NullStudentObjectException.
Compile and run the StudentMain class as a Java application.
The console will display the results of the validation, grade calculation, and summary report for invalid data.
9. What is the role of the StudentService object?
The StudentService class is responsible for performing various operations on the student data, such as:

Finding the number of null student objects.
Finding the number of students with null marks arrays.
Finding the number of students with null names.
It acts as the main service layer in the project, handling data validation and exception management.

10. What is the sample data provided for testing?
A separate sample dataset is used to test the program, containing student records with various valid and invalid data. This sample data can be used to simulate different validation scenarios, ensuring that the program handles all edge cases.
